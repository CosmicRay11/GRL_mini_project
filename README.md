# Graph Representation Learning mini-project
GitHub repository to store code as evidence for the Graph Representation Learning mini-project, submitted to University of Oxford over Christmas vacation 2022/23.
Code is mostly in ppi_gat_rni.ipynb, with some graph generation also in visualisation.ipynb

Question 3 in the file GRL exam.pdf pertains to the code in this repository, where I conduct experiments related to the question: "How does Random Node Initialisation (RNI) affect attention aggregation in Graph Attention Networks (GATs)?"

Example code for training a model on the PPI dataset was used and adapted in this study: 
https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric/blob/master/examples/ppi.py

---
Trained models get saved to a folder called best_models - statistics on their runnings are made available, but not the models themselves as the download task was too cumbersome.
