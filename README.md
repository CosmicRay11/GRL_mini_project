# GRL_mini_project
Anonymous GitHub repository to store code as evidence for the Graph Representation Learning mini-project, candidate number 1044704.

Code is mostly in ppi_gat_rni.ipynb, with some graph generation also in visualisation.ipynb

Example code for training a model on the PPI dataset was used and adapted in this study: 
https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric/blob/master/examples/ppi.py

---
Trained models get saved to a folder called best_models - statistics on their runnings are made available, but not the models themselves as the download task was too cumbersome.
